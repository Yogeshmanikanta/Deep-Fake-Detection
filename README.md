# Deep Fake Detection

## Overview

The Deep Fake Detection project is aimed at identifying and mitigating the effects of deep fake videos. Deep fake technology utilizes advanced artificial intelligence techniques, such as  Convolutional neural network(CNN), to create realistic-looking videos where people appear to say or do things they never actually did. This project leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect such manipulations and help maintain the integrity of video content.

## Features

- **Video Analysis**: Processes video files to detect anomalies that suggest deep fake manipulation.
- **Image Analysis**: Analyzes individual frames extracted from videos for signs of deep fake generation.
- **Model Training**: Provides scripts and tools to train detection models on labeled datasets.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes pre-trained models for immediate deployment and testing.
